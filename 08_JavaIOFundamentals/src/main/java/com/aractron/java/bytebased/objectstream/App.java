/**
 * An ObjectOutputStream writes primitive data types and graphs of Java objects to an OutputStream.
 * 
 *  - Objects to be written must implement serializable
 *  
 *  - Any object, including Strings and arrays, is written with writeObject.
 *  
 *  - Multiple objects or primitives can be written to the stream. 
 *  
 *  - The objects must be read back from the corresponding ObjectInputstream 
 *    with the same types and in the same order as they were written. 
 *  
 *  - Primitive data types can also be written to the stream using the appropriate 
 *    methods from DataOutput.
 *    
 *  - Strings can also be written using the writeUTF method.
 *  
 *  - The default serialization mechanism for an object writes 
 *       * the class of the object, 
 *       * the class signature, 
 *       * and the values of all non-transient and non-static fields.
 *       
 *  - References to other objects (except in transient or static fields) cause those 
 *    objects to be written also. 
 *    
 *  - Classes that require special handling during the serialization and deserialization 
 *    process must implement special methods with these exact signatures:  
 *    
 *       1) private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream) 		throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
 *       
 *       2) private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream) 	throws IOException
 *       
 *       		responsible for writing the state of the object for its particular class 
 *       		so that the corresponding readObject method can restore it.  State is saved 
 *       		by writing the individual fields to the ObjectOutputStream using the writeObject 
 *       		method or by using the methods for primitive data types supported by DataOutput.
 *       		Must call --defaultWriteObject--
 *       
 *       3) private void readObjectNoData()									throws ObjectStreamException;
 *       
 *   - Subclasses of Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case 
 *     the non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to be initialized.
 *     
 *   - Constructor of the class for an object being deserialized is never invoked.
 *   
 *   - If the object graph contains non-serializable objects, an exception is thrown and nothing 
 *     is serialized. Object graph means all the objects that are linked/referenced by the first 
 *     object (directly or indirectly) that is being serialized.
 *     
 *   - Any field that is not marked transient but points to an object of a class that does not 
 *     implement Serializable, will cause an exception to be thrown.

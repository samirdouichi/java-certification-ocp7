# "Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 7" training code 
It was created as a base for the android training session thus that java language is seen as a prerequest for android developpement



~~ Currentrly Work in Progress ~~

# Certification Topics

The project is made up of 10[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) modules, one for each macro topic. to Here the complete list:

  * Override hashCode, equals, and toString methods from Object class
  * Create and use singleton classes and immutable classes
  * Develop code that uses static keyword on initialize blocks, variables, methods, and classes
2. **Advanced Java Class Design**
  * Develop code that uses abstract classes and methods
  * Develop code that uses final keyword
  * Create inner classes including static inner class, local class, nested class, and anonymous inner class
  * Develop code that declares, implements and/or extends interfaces and use the atOverride annotation.
3. **Generics and Collections**
  * Create and use a generic class
  * Create and use ArrayList, TreeSet, TreeMap, and ArrayDeque ....

  * Create custom exceptions and Auto-closeable resources
  * Test invariants by using assertions
5. **Use Java SE 8 Date/Time API**
  * Create and manage date-based and time-based events including a combination of date and time into a single object using LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, Instant,  Period, and Duration
  * Work with dates and times across timezones and manage changes resulting from daylight savings including Format date and times values
  * Define and create and manage date-based and time-based events using Instant, Period, Duration, and TemporalUnit
6. **Java I/O Fundamentals**
  * Read and write data from the console
  * Use BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, File, FileReader, FileWriter, FileInputStream, FileOutputStream,ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream, ~~DataOutputStream,     	  	DataInputStream~~, ~~RandomAccessFile~~ and PrintWriter in the java.io package.
7. **Java Concurrency**
  * Create worker threads using Runnable
  * and use an ExecutorService to concurrently execute tasks
  * Identify potential threading problems among deadlock, starvation, livelock, and race conditions
8. **Building Database Applications with JDBC**
  * Describe the interfaces that make up the core of the JDBC API including the Driver, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet interfaces and their relationship to provider implementations
  * Identify the components required to connect to a database using the DriverManager class including the JDBC URL
  * Submit queries and read results from the database including creating statements, returning result sets, iterating through the results, and properly closing result sets, statements, and connections
9. **Localization**
  * Read and set the locale by using the Locale
  * Create and read a Properties
  * Build a resource bundle ** for each locale and load a resource bundle in an application
  * ~~Use NumberFormat, DateFormat and SimpleDateFormat classes
